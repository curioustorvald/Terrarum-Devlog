# Terrarum

The project is hosted on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/minjaesong/terrarum). It hit the LFS size of the GitHub and I don't know how to reduce it...

...so, instead of actual code on this repo, here's some screenshots:

Smooth lighting is achieved by a shader. Torch (it's not a candle!) casts realistic orange colour, which is based on colourimeter measurement. You'll be seeing more things with life-like colours such as this one in the future.

In the actual game, the torch flickers (gets brighter and darker) randomly, which mimics real-life fire.

![20170726 — The titlescreen.](titlescreen_koKR.png)

The titlescreen. This shows the main principal of the design — the minimalism. Fraps was open while taking the screenshot.

____

![20171107 — The inventory.](inventory_peek2.png)

One of the proposed inventory screen. May undergo some changes.

(note — the character in dark-coloured dress is just a dummy; you won't going to see it in the actual realease)
